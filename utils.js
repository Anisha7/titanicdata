// For this lab, you will work on writing functions to automate your visualizations. Keep these functions in a utils.js file that you can copy and reuse for your various assignments.

// These functions should take in color and size parameters, and return a configured object. You can make one of these functions for each shape for ease of creation for your assignments:

// Rectangle
// Rounded Rectangles
// Circle
// Eyes
// Droplets
// Leaves
// Stretch Challenges

// Create functions for compound shapes, or any other shapes you may use
// Have your functions take in a position parameter
// Have your functions take in a stroke parameter
